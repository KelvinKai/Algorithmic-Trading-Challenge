# Project 4: Open Project

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

As the data to be used in this project is very large, we have uploaded it to google drive. If you want to use it, please download it and put it the data file.
